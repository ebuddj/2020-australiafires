## Fires in Australia from 2008 to 2019 (EBU)

Bushfires in Australia impact extensive areas and cause property damage and have accounted for the deaths of 800 people in Australia since 1851. Major firestorms that result in severe loss of life are often named based on the day on which they occur, such as Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday. Some of the most intense, extensive and deadly bushfires commonly occur during droughts and heat waves, such as the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave, which precipitated the conditions during the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in which 180 people died. Other major conflagrations include the 1851 Black Thursday bushfires, the 2006 December bushfires and the ongoing 2019–20 bushfires.

Bushfires have always been a part of Australia's ecology and environment. Some of the country's native flora have evolved to rely on bushfires for reproduction, and fire events have been an interwoven part of the ecology of the continent for thousands of years. Aboriginal Australians used to use fire to clear grasslands for hunting and to clear tracks through dense vegetation; however this was only in periods of high rainfall and in very small grassland zones bordering desert.

Fire management, logging and farming strategies changed significantly with the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century. This led to more frequent bushfires. Heatwaves and drought associated with global warming have exacerbated the problem.

We gathered data from FIRMS of all the detected fires by the MOODS satellite and plottet the fires on a map. The maps clearly show that fires last year were not the widest but they have impacted more populated areas.
